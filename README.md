# **PyBer Analysis**

## *Overview of Analysis*
    -The purpose of the challenge analysis was to summarize the PyBer data by the different city types. This summary showed the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and the average fare per driver for the three different city types (rural, suburban, and urban).
    -Additionally, this analysis was done to provide an overview of the total fares by city types through a line graph.

## *Results*
    -This analysis allowed for us to compare the different data points by the different city types that were provided within it. The analysis showed that the rural cities experienced the lowest total rides, total drivers, and total fares, while experiencing the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.
    -Opposing this, the urban cities experienced the highest total rides, total drivers, and total fares, while experiencing the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.
    -The suburban cities fell in between the rual and urban citites under all the compared categories.
    -The line graph displays the pattern mentioned above, that the urban citites experencied the highest total fares, the rural citites experienced the lowest total fares, and the suburban cities fell in the middle between the months of January to April in 2019.
    -The line graph shows that the trend in the total fare across these three city types differs despite the same general increase between Febuary and March.

## *Summary*
    -One recommendation to address the disparities between the city types would be to incentivize drivers in rural cities. This would hopefully increase the total drivers in these areas, which would in turn, potentially increase the total rides through the higher driver availability.
    -Another recommendation to address the disparities between the city types would be to decrease the average fare per ride in the rural cities. This would hopefully increse the total rides in these areas by making the rides more affordable. 
    -A final recommendation to address the disparitites between the city types would be to increase the average driver fare in suburban cities. This would hopefully increase the total rides in these areas by hopefully attracting more drivers.
